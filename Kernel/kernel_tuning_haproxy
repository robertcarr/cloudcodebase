## Some generic TCP tuning properties that were useful w/HAProxy
##


#you'll run out of source ports, set it to 1
sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse=1

#    64000 soureports
sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range="1024 65023"


#  SYN Backlogs
sysctl -w  net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog=60000

#   reduce it to 30 to release sockets faster
sysctl -w  net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout=30

#    reduce it to 3 or even 2, otherwise you can saturate your listen
#    sockets during SYN flood attacks
sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_synack_retries=2
sysctl -w  net.core.somaxconn=60000
sysctl -w  net.core.netdev_max_backlog=10000
